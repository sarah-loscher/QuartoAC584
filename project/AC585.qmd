Welcome to the [***Journey of VitalSigns***]{style="color: orange;"} dashboard, an exploration of global dynamics in [*health, wealth, and well-being*]{style="color: orange;"} over the last twenty years. Embark on a visual expedition as we navigate through interconnected data from [**UNICEF**]{style="color: blue;"}, revealing the fascinating tapestry of our world's socio-economic landscape.

[**Unicef**]{style="color: blue;"} 
: Originally called the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund in full, now officially United Nations Children's Fund, is an agency of the United Nations responsible for providing humanitarian and developmental aid to children worldwide.

* [***Aims of this dashboard***]{style="color: red;"} 
    + Assessment of Healthcare Access
    + Monitoring Health Outcomes
        - We look at countries like India against the United States
    + Identification of Vulnerable Populations: 

# Taking a Worldwide View

## Global Population Diversity

Explore the distribution of [**world population in 2021**]{style="color: red;"} across countries in this interactive map. The colour intensity of each country represents its population size, with darker shades indicating larger populations. [*China and India*]{style="color: purple;"} stand out due to their significant populations. Their dark red colour reflects their immense demographic impact on the global population landscape.

```{r}

## Children receiving ORT around the globe

```{r}

As you explore, take note of how the colour of each country corresponds to its proportion; the darker the shade, the greater the number. There is a large percentage of children in <span style='color: purple;'>*India*</span> receiving ORT treatment, which is indicated on the map by the purple colour. The country faces a number of issues, including healthcare access and poverty."

# Relationship between Life Expectancy and ORT Treatment

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "The scatterplot shows an interesting <span style='color: red;'>**correlation between ORT treatment and life expectancy in 2021**</span>. Lower percentages of children receiving treatment is found in countries like <span style='color: purple;'>*the United States*</span> demonstrating longer life expectancies, reflecting better healthcare accessibility and quality. Conversely, <span style='color: purple;'>*Chad and Nigeria*</span>, with higher levels of ORT treatment being given to children, exhibit lower life expectancies due to limited economic resources hindering healthcare investments. This disparity underscores the high need for ORT treatment among vulnerable groups of children." 
scatterplot_1 <- ggplot(full_join_2021_countries) +
  aes(LifeExp,obs_value,color = country, size = population) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = 1), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +

# Average Life Expectancy

Next, explore [**life expectancy disparities**]{style="color: red;"} across selected countries in 2021 with the bar chart. [*India and Kenya*]{style="color: purple;"} exhibit lower life expectancies, reflecting the impact of poverty on public health. Limited access to healthcare, sanitation, and nutrition contributes to shorter life spans in these regions. In contrast, countries like [*China and the United States*]{style="color: purple;"} boast higher life expectancies, reflecting their socio-economic prosperity and robust healthcare systems.

```{r}
barchart <- newfilter_2021_countries %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(mean_lifeexp = mean(LifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(reorder(country, mean_lifeexp), mean_lifeexp, fill = country) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Country", 
       y = "Average Life Expectancy", 
       title = "Barchart of average life expectancy") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = 'Arial'))
  ggplotly(barchart)

# Conclusion

This dashboard highlights healthcare disparities between nations, emphasizing the critical importance of timely interventions like ORT therapy in combating childhood illnesses and reducing mortality rates. By prioritizing initiatives that enhance healthcare access, alleviate poverty, and empower marginalized populations, [**we can strive towards a future where every child has the opportunity to thrive and lead a healthy life.**]{style="color: orange;"}
